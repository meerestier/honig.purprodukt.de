# Rapid Bootstrap
«Rapid Bootstrap» is my toolkit for kickstarting web-projects, apps, and more. It includes a basic set of CSS elements optimized for perfect typography, a super simple fluid grid system and all necessary JavaScripts to develop mobile friendly websites. «Rapid Bootstrap» is especially built for [Hammer](http://hammerformac.com). This nifty little tool by Riot can help you to build a static HTML site even faster. If you don't own a copy of hammer you will find everything processed in the «Build» folder.
