<h1>Rapid Bootstrap</h1>
<p>«Rapid Bootstrap» is my toolkit for kickstarting web-projects, apps, and more. It includes a basic set of CSS elements optimized for perfect typography, a super simple fluid grid system and all necessary JavaScripts to develop mobile friendly websites. «Rapid Bootstrap» is especially built for <a href="http://hammerformac.com">Hammer</a>. This nifty little tool by Riot can help you to build a static HTML site even faster. If you don&#8217;t own a copy of hammer you will find everything processed in the «Build» folder.</p>
